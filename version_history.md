* Bugfix on resetting nodes properties (Thanks to Srdjan MarkoviÄ‡)
* Bugfix on path cost return

##1.5.2.1 (10/27/12)
* Bugfix (Thanks to Srdjan MarkoviÄ‡)

##1.5.2 (10/25/12)
* Fixed "tunneling" issue in diagonal-mode

##1.5.1.3 (10/18/12)
* Third-party 30log requiring enhanced
* Huge documentation update (See Readme)

##1.5.1.2 (10/17/12) - Fix 
* Bugfix with the previous commit (requiring third-party would not work with Löve2D, now fixed)

##1.5.1.2 (10/16/12)
* Fix on internal grid width calculation
* Added path to 30log in package.path
* Some code cleaning


##1.5.1.1 (10/15/12)
* Smoothing renamed to filling, self-explanatory (See Readme for public interface changes)

##1.5.1 (10/09/12)
* Fix for pathfinding with no diagonal moves allowed : paths returned looks more "natural".

##1.5.0 (10/06/12)

* Various improvements
* Updated Readme

##1.4.1 (10/04/12)
* Third-parties are now git submodules.
