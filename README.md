Jumper
======

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Yonaba/Jumper.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Yonaba/Jumper)

__Jumper__ is a pathfinding library designed for grid-based games. It aims to be __fast__ and __lightweight__.
It features a wide range of search algorithms, built within a clean interface with 
chaining features which makes it __very friendly and easy to use__.<br/>

__Jumper__ is written in pure [Lua][]. Thus, it is not __framework-related__ and can be used in any project embedding [Lua][] code.

##Installation

##Installing Jumper##
Copy the contents of the folder named [jumper](http://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper/blob/master/jumper) and its contents and place it inside your projet. Use *require* function to import any module of the library.

##A Simple Example of Use
Here is a simple example explaining how to use Jumper:

```lua
-- Usage Example
-- First, set a collision map
local map = {
	{0,1,0,1,0},
	{0,1,0,1,0},
	{0,1,1,1,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0},
}
-- Value for walkable tiles
local walkable = 0

-- Library setup
local Grid = require ("jumper.grid") -- The grid class
local Pathfinder = require ("jumper.pathfinder") -- The pathfinder lass

-- Creates a grid object
local grid = Grid(map) 
-- Creates a pathfinder object using Jump Point Search
local myFinder = Pathfinder(grid, 'JPS', walkable) 

-- Define start and goal locations coordinates
local startx, starty = 1,1
local endx, endy = 5,1

-- Calculates the path, and its length
local path = myFinder:getPath(startx, starty, endx, endy)
if path then
  print(('Path found! Length: %.2f'):format(path:getLength()))
	for node, count in path:nodes() do
	  print(('Step: %d - x: %d - y: %d'):format(count, node:getX(), node:getY()))
	end
end

--> Output:
--> Path found! Length: 8.83
--> Step: 1 - x: 1 - y: 1
--> Step: 2 - x: 1 - y: 3
--> Step: 3 - x: 2 - y: 4
--> Step: 4 - x: 4 - y: 4
--> Step: 5 - x: 5 - y: 3
--> Step: 6 - x: 5 - y: 1
